# simple_server

A club project at the Turing school where we're taught Javascript by Julian Feliciano, we are working off of his github page found below,
https://github.com/julsfelic/from_ruby_to_node

Please read Julian's write up first but once you get the basics installed, below should get you going

The basics are first clone the project, git clone!
The first step is type $ npm init
The next step is $ npm install express --save
To run, clone project down and type $ node server.jsf

now checkout your local host! you should immediately see Example app listening on port 3000!
now go to http://localhost:3000/
tight!!
